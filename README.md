## Wildfire AQI Tracker

This tracker is built to provide users with the up-to-date air quality index (AQI) for areas recently affected by wildfires. As wildfires become more prevalent, it is important to track their long-term effects on a community, particularly the air quality as residents and disaster relief officials rebuild in the weeks and months after the first. This tracker uses NASA-sourced wildfire data and current an OpenWeather air quality index to make this information available.
